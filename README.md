# Chatbot

This is a simple chatbot implementation using Node.js and readlineSync. The chatbot responds to user input with a predefined message.

## Getting Started

To run the chatbot, follow these steps:

1. Install Node.js and npm on your computer.
2. Clone this repository to your local machine.
3. Navigate to the repository directory in your terminal.
4. Run `npm install` to install the required dependencies.
5. Run `node index.js` to start the chatbot.

## Usage

To interact with the chatbot, type your questions or statements in the terminal and press enter. The chatbot will respond with a predefined message. To quit the chatbot, type "exit" and press enter.

## Code Structure

The code is organized into two main functions:

* `getChatbotResponse(input)`: This function generates a response to the user's input and returns it as a Promise.
* `startChatbot()`: This function starts the chatbot and prompts the user for input. It calls `getChatbotResponse()` to generate a response to the user's input.

## Customization

To customize the chatbot's responses, modify the `generateChatbotResponse(input)` function in `chatbot.js`. You can use a simple keyword-based system or a more advanced NLP model to generate responses.
